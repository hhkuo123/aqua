    <p>
    Aquamarine is a pale-blue to light-green variety of the beryl family,with its name relating to water and sea.
    The color of aquamarine can be changed by heat, with a goal to enhance its physical appearance (though this practice is frowned upon by collectors and jewelers). 
    It is the birth stone of March.
    Aquamarine is a fairly common gemstone, rendering it more accessible for purchase, compared to other gems in the beryl family.
    Overall, its value is determined by weight, color, cut, and clarity.
    It is transparent to translucent and possesses a hexagonal crystal system.[9] Aquamarine mainly forms in granite pegmatites and hydrothermal veins,and it is a very lengthy process that can take millions of years to form.
    Aquamarine occurs in many countries over the world, and is most commonly used for jewelry, decoration and its properties.
    Aquamarine is mainly extracted through open-pit mining, however underground mining is also a possibility to access aquamarine reserves.
    Aquamarine is a durable gemstone, but it highly recommended to conserve it on its own to prevent damage/scratches.
    Famous aquamarines include the Dom Pedro, the Roosevelt Aquamarine, the Hirsch Aquamarine, Queen Elizabeth's Tiara, Meghan Markle's ring, and the Schlumberger bow.

    Some background, I've never had any kind of negative feelings towards obama, in fact, I always kinda liked the guy.

The problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said "Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?

A week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of "The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly "Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.

The most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely "excuse me for one moment" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my GF saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.

If you read my last post, you know that after many years of hiding my fart fetish, my wife (24) finally found out, and has been talking dirty to me about her farts ever since. Up until tonight, although she'd been putting her ass in my face and talking about farting, she hadn't actually farted in front of me. But tonight it finally happened! After spending an evening with friends, as soon as we got in the car she said, "Did you smell any of my farts tonight?" Still a bit stunned, I kind of laughed and said, "No... you had another stinky night tonight?" I then asked her to show me her panties quickly before driving home because-side note-panties are another one of my kinks. She was wearing spaghetti string, full-bum, black cotton panties—a favorite of mine. Anyway, I could barely drive home because my mind was racing so fast as I imagined her pressing her butt into my face when we got home. This time, I was careful to keep the conversation focused on her "stinkys" as she calls them, thinking l'd have a better chance to experience one. As soon as we walked in the door, we kissed and I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom (she's very petite but has a bubble butt). I unzipped her jeans and had to wiggle them down over her butt until they finally hit the floor. I kissed her again and looked her in the eyes and said "Now show me see that stinky ass". She blushed and was still clearly shy about the whole thing, but she listened and crawled on top of me as soon as my back hit the bed. Like last time, she started talking dirty almost immediately saying, "You like my stinky ass don't you?" and "I've been getting my little black panties so stinky all day for you". I felt euphoric, again, this is brand new for us. Then I somehow mustered the courage to say, "you know, if you need to make another stinky, you don't need to move off of me like last time". She was silent for a moment and then said, "I think I'm going to make a stinky". At this point I was throbbing... I said something like "that's okay, baby" and pulled her ass closer to my face so my nose was pressed right on her panty-covered hole. Then, in that glorious moment, with my face pressed against her panty ass, I felt her body move in a way that told me she was beginning to push a little bit.... And that's when it happened. She pushed the cutest little fart out of her ass, through her tight cotton panties, and into my face. It was about a second long, higher pitched, and it honestly smelled sweet to me. I was so turned on that I immediately fucking exploded everywhere as she let out a little turd on me.
